# NBU-CIQAD and the proposed method for cartoon image quality assessment
NBU-CIQAD includes 100 reference images, 1800 SCCIs degraded only by one distortion on six degradation levels, and 800 MCCIs de-graded by two or three types of distortion on four degradation levels.

## üí° Abstract
In the animation industry, automatically predicting the quality of cartoon images based on the inputs of general distortions and color change is an urgent task, while the existing no-reference (NR) methods usually measure the perceptual quality of the natural images. In this paper, based on the observation that structure and color are the main factors affecting cartoon images quality, we proposed a new NR quality prediction metric for cartoon images, which fully takes gradient and color information into account. The experimental results on our newly constructed NBU-CIQAD dataset with color change and other existing cartoon image dataset demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms existing no-references methods for the task of cartoon image quality assessment.

## üçé Noting 
- **Usage** :
   You can run 'demo.m' to get the feature vector and the predict score. 
   > **Input**:   
        img: test image  
   > **Output**:   
        features: the feature vector  
        score: the quality of the test image (Higher score means better image quality)
- **Train** :  
  We provide the folder ( i.e., Train).
  Run All_SVR.m / SCCIs_SVR.m / MCCIs_SVR.m to predict the quality scores and calculate the correlation 
  between subjective and objective scores.
